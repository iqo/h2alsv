# Z-Wave Producer
<!--

-->
This module collects the data sent by the Zwave strips to preconfigured OpenHab api, reconfigure the data into a workable 'JSON' structure with some additional useful information for the RabbitMQ server. This module is easy to use and configure with the accompanied 'toml' config file. The module is coded in 'python' and fully 'asyncio' based with threding. 

## Starting the Zwave module
To start the module run:
```bash
python Zwave_recorder.py
```
The default behaviour for the Zwave module is to collect and send data to RabbitMQ indefinetly (until terminated).

## Configuration

The Zwave module loads a file called `config.toml` in the root directory.
This config is used to configure Zwave settings, connection to the Openhab websocket, async and rabbitMQ.

The config file is structured just as below.

```toml

[rabbitmq]
username = "...."
password = "...."
host = "...."
routing_key = "..."


[asynctimer]
#Await asyncio sleep time
aast = 1

[Items]
#ur zwave items (can be done here or in the script)


[connection]
sensor_exchange = "...."
log_exchange = "..."

[Ip_address to openhab]
Ip = "..."

[logging]
handlers = ['....', '....']

```
## Payload specification
Zwave has four diffrent kinds of payloads, the open/closed events that occur and a heartbeat. When you start the Zwave_recorder it also checks all the available sensors and returns none if the sensor is unavilable.
